      <h2>Understanding Wheelbarrow Tire Issues</h2>
      <p>A flat wheelbarrow or a slow leak tire can be highly frustrating. Instead of inspecting the damage and root cause of the error, sometimes we just opt for the costly solution of tire replacement.</p>
      
      <p>However, with proper assessment and the right tools, many tire issues can be resolved through simple repairs, saving both time and money.</p>
      
      <h3>When to Repair vs Replace</h3>
      
      <h4>Repair is suitable for:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Small punctures from nails or screws</li>
        <li>Minor valve stem issues</li>
        <li>Small tears in the tire sidewall</li>
        <li>Slow air leaks from minor damage</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Replacement is necessary when:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Large tears or cuts in the tire</li>
        <li>Extensive sidewall damage</li>
        <li>Multiple punctures</li>
        <li>Tire tread is completely worn</li>
        <li>Repeated repair failures</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Cost Comparison</h3>
      <p>Repairing a wheelbarrow tire typically costs 10-20% of the replacement cost. A tire repair kit costs around $10-15 and can fix multiple punctures, while a new tire can cost $30-80 depending on quality and size.</p>
      
      <h3>DIY Repair Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Locate the puncture by submerging the tire in water</li>
        <li>Clean the area around the damage</li>
        <li>Apply the patch according to kit instructions</li>
        <li>Allow proper curing time</li>
        <li>Reinflate and test</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Remember, safety should always be your priority. If you're unsure about the extent of damage or the repair quality, it's better to replace the tire to avoid potential accidents.</p>

      <h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing Industrial Wheels</h2>
      <p>The right wheel selection can significantly impact productivity, safety, and maintenance costs in industrial applications.</p>
      
      <h3>Load Capacity</h3>
      <p>Always choose wheels that can handle 25% more than your maximum expected load to ensure safety and longevity.</p>
      
      <h3>Surface Conditions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smooth surfaces:</strong> Hard wheels (PU, nylon) for easy rolling</li>
        <li><strong>Rough terrain:</strong> Pneumatic or semi-pneumatic wheels for shock absorption</li>
        <li><strong>Wet conditions:</strong> Wheels with good traction and corrosion resistance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Wheel Types Comparison</h3>
      <h4>Pneumatic Wheels</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Excellent shock absorption</li>
        <li>Good traction on various surfaces</li>
        <li>Requires maintenance (air pressure)</li>
        <li>Can puncture</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>PU Wheels</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Puncture-proof</li>
        <li>Chemical resistant</li>
        <li>Low rolling resistance</li>
        <li>Limited shock absorption</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Solid Rubber Wheels</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintenance-free</li>
        <li>Good for heavy loads</li>
        <li>Durable in harsh environments</li>
        <li>Higher rolling resistance</li>
      </ul>
